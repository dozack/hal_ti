The TI Hercules HAL provides core and peripheral hardware drivers for the
Texas Instruments Hercules family of SoCs.

This HAL was generated using the TI HALCoGen utility, and was refactored and
customised for integration into the Zephyr codebase.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
  This is a preliminary HAL implementation intended for use only with RM46L852
  SoC. It will be updated to support more variants as development progresses
  and eventually generalised to support all Hercules family SoCs.
